# WineNotes 
WineNotes is a convenient note taking app that will allow anyone to quickly jot down notes
about a particular wine when needed. If you're at a vineyard, a festival, a grocery store, or a
friends house, you can take note of the wine you tried and liked to remember for later!

# Summary of Code
This app uses many fundamentals that include Coroutines, RecyclerView, MenuOptions, and a connected 
database. The database is setup using Room API to access an SQLite database. One table is created 
for simplicity and a Dao interface is used to add, update, delete, and query the notes.
